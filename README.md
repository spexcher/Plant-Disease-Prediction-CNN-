# Plant-Disease-Prediction-CNN-
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately predict plant diseases from images. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images with labeled diseases and uses advanced data augmentation techniques and a tuned model architecture to enhance performance.
